## Describe

This project was created under the pretense of transferring Greek mythology into a Minecraft plugin. \
It features Thor's hammer \
and hints of other mythological weapons.

### Information

This project is archived, and I currently have no plans to revive or rework it. \
However, it is entirely open to anyone who wants to use or modify it at any time. \
Looking back, my approach was not the best, and there were many mistakes!
